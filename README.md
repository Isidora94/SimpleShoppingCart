# SimpleShoppingCart
Simple Bootstrap, CSS, PHP shopping cart.

ER_diagram.png is entity relationship diagram of my Product table used for this cart, as you see my column price is VARCHAR data type cause I didn't upgrade my Workbench, so you should use MONEY() data type instead.

Bootstrap is used for this project, sush as external CSS for my own stylish certain things.

I don't prefer procedural programming very much, but this is one quick and simple solution .
